            <h2>What is Camping in the Forest?</h2>
            <p > 
                Camping is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from home, either without shelter or using basic shelter such as a tent or a recreational vehicle. Typically participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment or an educational experience. The night (or more) spent outdoors distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking and other similarly short-term recreational activities
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Going camping with my family and friends is an incredible experience.All of the excitement
                starts one week before we actually go. Packing, arranging, and rearranging fills the week. We need to make sure there is plenty of food and the basic essentials like shelter, water, and wood.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Once it is time to go, my family, my friends and I are ready to go without hesitating for a second. On our way to the snow capped mountains, We discuss old times that we have had, and tell new jokes that we have heard. Some of my siblings sleep, but I am too excited so I could not sleep well. Aside from the games, the passing forest and waterfalls keep my attention.
            </p> 
            <p>
                When we finally arrive, it is like we never left. The mountains, trees, and twigs
                are all in their proper place. The river is running as smooth as glass. All the animals are
                curiously watching the new arrivals in their territory. The sun is at high noon, and we are
                all in great spirits. The campsite is littered with trees and organised by nature. Large
                rocks surround the fire pit,and pine needles carpet the ground.    
            </p> 
            <p>
                My dad, mother, brothers, sisters, and I start to unload our gear. It seems like it is taking us forever, and each one of
                We have a job to do. Melaina, my older sister, and I set our tents up next to each other, so
                that we do not get scared. Next the lanterns are being set up, and the fire pit stocked with
                wood.            
            </p>
            <p> 
                Finally! All tents are set up, and camp is ready!
                Then we all settle down to listen to my dad explain the scavenger hunt he has in mind. He says, “Each of you will have a list of ten things, consisting of pine-cones, nails, rubber bands, pop tabs and many more objects. Each item is in a different order on each list.” As he was talking, I grew more and more excited about this huntHe continued by talking about it and we saw a deer drinking water in a lake and what it did see was a crocodile trying to hunt down the deer. When it murdered the deer, it was scary and kind of felt bad for deer because it just wanted to to drink water and has to scracifie it life to drink it. After that scary moment, we went for a walk and we breathed the air which we are not used to breathe in cities.
